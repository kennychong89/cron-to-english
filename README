Summary: This is a simple Python module that retrieves a crontab file and
translates each crontab line into an English representation of that line.

 For example:
 03 12 * 4 * echo "Hello World!" >> test.txt 

 would translate into:
 "The command will append the text "Hello World!" into test.txt at 12:03 PM everyday of the week starting April."

Current Tasks:

Feel free to contribute or give some suggestions :D.
