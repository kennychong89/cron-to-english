Summary: This is a simple tool written in Python that retrieves a crontab file and
translates each crontab line into an English representation of that line.

 For example:
 03 12 * 4 * echo "Hello World!" >> test.txt 

 would translate into:
 "The command will append the text "Hello World!" into test.txt at 12:03 PM everyday of the week starting April."

Update:
'CronToEnglish.py' is added and needs some retooling. Added a sandbox directory for testing modules or applications.

Current Tasks for 'CronToEnglih.py':
1) Add more functionality to module, for example, handling a cron line '*/3 * * * * command' to say 'command will run every 3 minutes' 
2) Setup the module to read and extract cron lines from a cron file 
3) Error handling 					      	                                      
4) Refactor code 					                                            
5) Unit testing  					                                              
6) Convert it into a Python module 			                              

Completed Tasks:
1) Wrote the basic functionalities that will allow the tool to convert cron lines into an English translation. (Completed Nov 20th, 2013)
2) 
3) 

Feel free to contribute or give some suggestions :D.
